        We are a group of three dedicated students on a mission to raise
        awareness, foster confidence, and encourage openness among the people of
        Pakistan. Our project aims to shed light on the various crimes that
        occur in society and their legal implications. By sharing knowledge and
        promoting dialogue, we strive to empower individuals to understand their
        rights and protect themselves from harm.
